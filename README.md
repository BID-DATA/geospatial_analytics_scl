## Description 
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of code for preprocessing geospatial data in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The repository aims to facilitate data analysis and exploration by providing code examples and modules (.py) for obtaining various datasets related to the region's population, administrative boundaries, social infrastructure, and more. This repository's **main objective** is to create a centralized and continuously updated resource for preprocessing and analyzing geospatial data in the region. By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, the repository aims to support research, analysts, and policymakers in conducting in-depth geospatial analysis and generating valuable insights for the region. 

This repository includes scripts and instructions for obtaining the following datasets: 

1. High-resolution population density map from [Meta](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/high-resolution-population-density-maps)

2. Shapefiles at the administrative level 1 and 2 from Humanitarian Data Exchange [(HDX)](https://data.humdata.org/)

3. Social infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals, and other amenities is obtained from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

4. Health infrastructure includes hospitals, clinics, and more from [healthsites.io](https://healthsites.io/). 

5. Official data on social infrastructure is shared by the countries in the region. The structure of these datasets varies across countries. Right now we have official records for Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Peru. For further details about the data sources, please refer to the [documentation](https://scldata.iadb.org/app/folder/874B76A4-5B3C-467C-A31F-A0D9FA9B1F01#tab-documentation).

6. Connectivty data from [Ookla's Open Data Initiative](https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data)
